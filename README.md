# loading-image-opencv
The basic code to upload an image using opencv in python

# Reminder:

Different application of opencv requires different version of python. As for me, Im using python 3.7 with opencv 4.1 as these is the latest version that can support the non-free opencv algorithm during my time.

All the codes were originally learned from youtube channeled : Pysource (all his code works!)
